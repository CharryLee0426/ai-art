# AI Art

## Introduction

A model, called stable diffusion, changed the world on August 22, 2022. It changes the concept of ART absolutely. Before stable diffusion, art is considered as an industry that can not be invaded by AI. Most people, including me, believe that only human can create real Art because only human understand what aesthetic is. However, AI can do many things in Art industry. It can create good images based on text(we called 'prompt' in AI), redraw or modify image from base image, and even generate shorts based on text or sequence of images. Everyone should adjust to the world with AI. So do I. This repo stores my thinking, workflow, and notes about AI Art. I hope it can help me review the knowledge quickly and help others who are interested in AI Art.
